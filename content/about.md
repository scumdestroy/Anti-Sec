Hey there, young one! 
I am Jann, a certified penetration tester (OSCP, eCPPTv2, eWPT, CompTIA Pentest+) and offsec cybermage with a particular interest and specialization in API and web hacking.  
- I have found bugs in bug bounty programs for companies such as Yahoo, Lucasfilm, Red Bull, Razer, Indeed, UnderArmour, Merck, and many more. I am also a part of Yogosha's web hacking team and Pentabug's Red Team. In addition to my penetration testing work, I have worked for Linode and Akamai as a technical writer on cloud computing and networking topics.
- I've just started hunting CVE's this year and am responsible for CVE-2023-3275, CVE-2023-5303, CVE-2023-5304 and CVE-2023-5305.
These vulnerabilities unleashed a critical SQL injection that revealed all users' private information, including their addresses, photos, and SSNs, as well as three Stored XSS vulnerabilities. 
- I've also hit top ten USA and top 50 overall on TryHackMe.com, a website with over 2 million users.

Thanks for reading, and please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss a potential project.
